At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust. This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper! While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration, ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous. For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy, the continuous, gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief, powerful, but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets.

How powerful is this high-tech spacecraft's ion propulsion system? At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust. This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper! While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration, ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous. For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy, the continuous, gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief, powerful, but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets. Pictured here during ground tests, the Deep Space 1 craft is now about three million miles from planet Earth.\\\", 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', ..."
